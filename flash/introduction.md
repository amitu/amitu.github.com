Flash can be argued to be a dying technology, but this is the time I picked to
learn Flash. I have always wanted to learn it, but I never "got it". I can not
think in the "visual way". Learning flash used to be about learning the IDE.

Luckily one can do first class flash programming today with actionscript3. AS3
is a javascript like language, with support for classes, namespaces, optional
variable types etc.

There are command line tools to compile flash, but I have found the easiest way
to do flash project using "Adobe Flash Builder". This is an eclipse based IDE,
while I generally dislike IDEs, eclipse backing with support for refactoring,
type based auto complete, debugger has mostly over come my problems with IDEs.
