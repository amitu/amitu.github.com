I came across another interesting article via
[@rahulg](https://twitter.com/rahulg), a New Yorker post: [Coaching a Surgeon:
What Makes Top Performers
Better?](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/03/111003fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all).
Must read article.

Raises some very interesting questions:

I think it will happen, purely because coaching is a real earning opportunity.
