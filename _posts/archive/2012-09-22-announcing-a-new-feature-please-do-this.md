You got a new release or new feature of your awesome software/library/startup,
and you write a blog post about it, and put it on hackernews? Good job. But
please do yourself and your readers a favor and include a paragraph aimed
towards an audiance that learns about your software/library/startup for the
first time.

It is vain to assume people who come to your latest announcement page knows
about you. It gets picked up by hacker news, by r/programming, twitter etc.

Yes people can click on homepage, and but in so many cases the home button
takes you to the home page of the blog, which then shows the same very post. It
is utterly idiotic to have a blog about a startup/library, whose "home" is
linked to blog home page blog.something.com instead of something.com.

Thank you.

PS: If you read any article on techcrunc etc, they include a blurb about the
companies mentioned. This is a responsible thing to do, they will describe what
google does in every article they write about google, your software/startup is
not as well known as google/facebook, please accept this.
