Today I learnt the meaning of [Upadhyay on
Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upajjhaya). I always knew it was some
kind of teacher, and it is indeed:

    An upadhyaya is specifically a professional teacher in the technical
    subjects of Vedanga, i.e. Sanskrit grammar and other basic skills required
    for the perusal of the Vedas. In this he is distinguished from an acharya,
    a spiritual teacher or guide who introduces the student to the religious
    mysteries of the Vedas.

Given my passion for teaching, I feel it is quite fitting :-)

PS: I might be starting a campaign in future of discarding ones surnames and
picking new ones as a means to end caste system in India, so please do not read
too much into this post.
