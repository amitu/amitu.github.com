How can you not love a man who goes to a room full of people and tells them you
are all fools and makes a good case about it.

He does have a point, all hindi supporters keep talking about hindi vs english,
where as hindi's biggest role would be to unify india. Bollywood is the most
popular hindi teaching school, majority of India already knows hindi, if local
states accepted hindi, it would be very easy for them to learn hindi, and hindi
has potential of becoming a common language that english can not, beyond the
elite. Not as a compulsion but as an option.

I love how he takes unconventional positions, justies them using logic and
reasoned arguments, and is a shining beacon of freedom in India.
