After sitting on it for months I finally took some time to finish up [my first
newsletter](/weekly/1.html).

I started this experiment primarily to share links on my blog/email instead of
on facebook/twitter, as facebook and twitter are very good at losing them (this
is not how you scale guys!) and to give myself more control.

I usually read articles on Instapaper, so most of my work was predone, I liked
the links I considered for adding it over there, and added them in the html one
time before sending the newsletter. It is still a bit more work than I like,
editing HTML by hand. The structure I have is quite templatized, and I guess I
will be writing a few scripts to make this easier.

The very first attempt all ended in SPAM folder due to some [stupidity
mailchimp did](/2012/10/yo-mailchimp-test-your-test-mail-bro/). I *hate* their
click tracking, which I can not disable in the free version, hate my clean URL
getting clobbered.

I am not sure if I will be sticking to weekly frequency or not, but it feels
the most reasonable as of now. I guess some weeks may be longer than others if
I am upto something else.

It is still not conversational as I initially thought, lets see.
