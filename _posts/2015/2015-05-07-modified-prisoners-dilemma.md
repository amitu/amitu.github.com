Say a law is being proposed:

> 50% of society would be sent to prison for 7 days. Since there arenâ€™t enough
> jails, the prison period would be in rotation. A queue would be formed, and
> people would go to prison in the order in queue. People who vote for this law
> would be placed at the end of queue, people who vote against it would be
> placed in the front of the queue. Voting is instant. In case of ties you will
> be placed at random [all YEs will be placed in back at random order, all NEs
> will be in front in random order, all absentees in the middle in random
> order].

> If less than 50% vote YE, the law would not be passed.

How will you vote and why?

What if no YEs are sent to jail and only absentees and NEs are sent to jail?
