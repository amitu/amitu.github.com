So I am leaving Facebook again. Last attempt was not very successful. Lets see
why it failed, and why I think this attempt has higher chances of success.

1. I kept Facebook around as I considered it a wastage of time, a minor harm.
   But now I have changed my opinion that Facebook is actively harmful for me,
   and things I stand for. So the resolve was softer last time, and harder this
   time.
2. I decided to create a mailing list as alternative to keep in touch with my
   friends. This was a good move, but I made a tactical error. I asked for what
   kind of content you could be interested and and was worried about spam. Big
   mistake. So this time I am creating a new mailing list, and this time it is
   going to be called spam@amitu.com. This is SPAM. Expect SPAM. My facebook
   posts were SPAM. I did not think twice before posting anything there. I will
   keep it limited, but fuck you, if you want to keep in touch with me, mail me,
   or subscribe to my spam.
3. Deactivating account. I did not do it, as I thought I will continue to have
   conversations (but original content will go on my blog, big failure).
   Deactivation I have seen some friends do, and I have seen them come back.
   Also there is whole problem of all the sites that I have signed up on using
   Facebook. Its a convenience, and I am not going to set myself for any hurdle
   I need not. So I am going not deactivate my account or change password or
   anything like that. I am going to delete my friends. If I see any post by
   you, and I vaguely recall your name, I will block you. I can still use
   facebook, but I have nothing there. Worst case, even if I unblock a few, I
   will have only those few, and not the 600 I have got right now. Less friends,
   more boring feed, less reason to come back to Facebook.

So I am hopeful it will work better this time. Subscribe to spam@amitu.com,
and/or mail me. Follow me on twitter. Keep in touch.

You can do it too. Cull everyone you do not absolutely need. Creating a mailing
list is trivial. Call it SPAM.
