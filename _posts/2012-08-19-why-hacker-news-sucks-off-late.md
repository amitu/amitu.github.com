So I get some free time from work and decide to check hacker news. I open the
site, and I find a few interesting stories on the first page. I ctrl-click on a
few to open them in new tab, read a few of them, and close the tab. I reach the
bottom of first page and I click on "next", and hacker news shows me "Unknown
or expired link."

I am forced to reload the main page, and then click on the next button. And if
I was on the second page etc, I am forced to go to first page, reload, quickly
click on next a few times.

There are a lot of posts on hackernews about how the quality of hackernews is
going down, because of the increasing difference between the votes on stories
on the first page vs the ones that comes on subsequent pages. 

My theory: it is because of this incredibly "cheap" caching policyToday second
page has become very hard to access and subsequent pages are nearly impossible
to visit.
