title: "Unrestricted Freedom Of Speech -- Where Exactly Is India, Ms. Doniger?"

{% include JB/setup %}

I have been demanding from a long time, unlimited freedom of speech. Nothing to
be banned or censored. Most people agree about freedom of speech, but most
people in India want some sort of restraints. A lot of people want hate speech
to be not allowed.

Now there is two main problems with "hate speech should not be allowed" idea.
First, the moment you have such a rider, it becomes very difficult to decide for
yourself when a free speech becomes a hate speech.

The other day I read a story about how a kid died because parents decided to
treat the kid using alternative medicine procedure, in line with their religious
belief. And let me be absolutely clear about it, I hate these parents. There are
monsters and there are these parents.

Now tell me, I am clearly expressing hate towards such religious people, does it
mean my speech is hate speech and must be banned? Do you have any feeling for
parents who are willing to kill their kids for religious beliefs, but that of
hate?

So you see, deciding a speech to be worth banning is a difficult task. I would
bet I am doing nothing immoral here by hating such people, and demanding you
hate them too. But as per the law the speech is criminal.

So this is the first problem. The moment you add that clause about "not hate
speech", you basically drastically increase the work pressure on courts, you
create a lot of criminals who had done nothing immoral who do not deserve jail
time. You have basically wasted a lot of time. Sure some speech would be
immoral, but "not hate speech" is not suffecient indicator to identify that
speech, and you need the judgement of judges of court to make sure that "not
hate speech" part is used only in the right cases. The law itself doesnt help,
its the wisdom of judge which saves us from the stupidity of the law.

This post is about the second problem with hate speech. You see if you ban a
speech, an idea, a book, it does not disapper next day. Murder and rape are
"banned", we still have them.

Please understand there is very little you can do to stop the spread of hate
speech. Yes, it will go away from main stream sources. You will not see the book
sold in main stream book stores, but book will be still sold. The video may be
taken away from YouTube, but it would still be there in torrents.

You see, by banning a hate speech, or a speech that hurts sentiments of
religion, you do not reduce that speech, you just remove the possibility of
rebuttal of that speech.

In religious contexts, it often happens that people of one religion say
something bad about the other religion. It happens in India. Now lets say
something bad was said against Hindus by Muslims. Say they point towards a flaw
in Hindus. The common thinking is if we do not immediately ban this speech there
would be a riot among Hindus and Muslims.

So you ban it. But it did not stop it from spreading. What has stopped on the
other hand is Hindus learning about that speech. What has been stopped is Hindus
articulating a response of that speech.

If we allowed that speech to be public. The most coherent, informative response
to that speech would have emerged. The fundamental problem being addressed would
have been more researched. In from of Muslims Hindu response would have been
presented. Muslims, who will read about the hate speech, who, in absence of a
proper response would believe that partially suppressed speech, would be denied
seeing a proper Hindu response.

Lets take this example:

There is a book "The Hindus: An Alternative History" by Ms. Wendy Doniger, this
book was banned in India. Which does not stop people from reading the book, it
only means Hindus sitting in India are blind about book and are not writing in
defence of Hinduism against the points made in India.

Since Hindus in India have been made blind by Indian government, a Muslim in
Bangladesh, Ali Sheikh, [helped us out](http://www.amazon.in/review/R1XA7KWW

Tell me after reading this, what do you really wish, should we have such
brilliant sensible responses to all books written against Hindus, and really
stop the spread of wide spread anti Hindu feelings in the world, or should we
gouge out eyes of Hindus as our popular culture demands and government obliges?

Hindus know Christians for example are writing such books. Not all, but some. We
ban those books. We pretend the chapter is closed. But it does not get closed.
Some Christians come to Hindu villages with that book, or if not that book, with
those ideas. Suddenly a Hindus of the village sees those ideas. But those poor
Hindus get denied the proper ammunition to defend against those books and ideas
as government of India has happily blinded Hindus from learning about those
books and preparing an intelligent response. So that poor Hindu in that village
tries to defend on his own, but he is not as smart as the whole of Hindus
combined. He can not on his own come up with a proper response.

The effect of this is he gets laughed at by those Christians etc, and this
frustrates him. He knows he is right but he does not have the way to articulate
things, to have proper research etc. Out of this frustration he then swears to
take care of Christians using other means available.

This is the effect of banning books. By banning a book you are not preventing
religious hatredness, you are instilling a deep rooted anger and hate.

Allow hate speech to spread. So we can respond to them. Becasue people who are
sympathetic to that speech will find out a way to access it despite ban, and
people who can refute the speech would not be able to prepare a proper response.

Hate speeches must be responded, articulately, with research. They are not to be
banned.
