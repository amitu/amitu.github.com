On June 26th, 2012 I wrote the following mail to Lucknow Airport Public
Relations Officer:

I got prompt reply, first reply at 10PM in the night! To my dismay the report
was closed:

To this I replied:

I got no reply from them afterwards and I considered matter closed. Till I
visited lucknow airport on my next trip, this is what I saw:

As you can see they implemented my "Proposal 2". On left is Gate 2, domestic
flights, and right is Gate 1 for international flights. When I wrote the mail
it was a glass wall, now it has been opened.

Ye! :-)
