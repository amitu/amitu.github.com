Sometime back I learnt that [sitting may be bad for my
health](/2012/10/sitting-considered-bad/) I have been looking for a standing
desk solution. I am not yet sure if standing desk would work out for me, or if
it does, what sort of desk I would need, so I am not too keen on investing any
money yet.

Today I came upon the idea of using my fridge as my desk. It is the right
height:

There is plenty of room for my laptop and my arms to rest.

Unlike some advice I heard in ergonomics, I prefer to rest my entire arm from
elbow to wrist on the table, so I needed some room for my arms.

As luck would have it my kitchen has fan, and the weather is such that AC is
not really required.

I worked about 4 hours today on it. My feet hurt. There is slight physical
tiredness, but my neck and back feels great. I moved around a lot, walking away
as soon as I start thinking, and coming back to laptop when I decide I have to
read/write something.
