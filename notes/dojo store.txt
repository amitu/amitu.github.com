dojo store

----------
We can also refer to functions by name, and they will be looked up as a method on the store:

store.lessThanTen = function(product){
  return product.price < 10;
});
store.query("lessThanTen").forEach(function(shoe){
  // called for each match
});

-----------

__setTitleAttr: { node: "titleNode", type: "innerHTML" }

the setter for "tab-index" is setTabIndexAttr() not "setTab-indexAttr"().
