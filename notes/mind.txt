its all connected. when you go from one idea to next that are familiar, it 
"makes sense", while if you find a new path but you can keep circling it, its a
"new idea", and both of these are very comforting, later quite rewarding, but 
what we dispise is a taking a "randoom walk", when our ideas keep leading to 
patters we havent accepted/understood, in that case there is a feeling of 
discomfort.
