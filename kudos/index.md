#### Kudos Using Parse For Jekyll

Kudos:

> [Dustin Kurtis](http://dustincurtis.com/) came up with an excellent idea for
> the [Svbtle](http://svbtle.com/) blogging network (go visit
> [Svbtle.com](http://svbtle.com/) to see an example). He called them Kudos.
> They're little widgets next to each post that enable users to give "Kudos" to
> posts they really like. You hover over the widget, it gives a fun little
> animation, and changes the icon and count after a moment.

A working demo at the bottom of this post (if everything went as planned).

that does the animation.
