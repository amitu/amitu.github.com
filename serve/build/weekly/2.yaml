    - Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know:
        http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/research/interactive_latency.html:
            Nice interactive presentation about data related to latency in
            memory, storage, network etc over time.

    - I am a fan of YAML:
        https://github.com/amitu/amitu.github.com/blob/master/weekly/2.yaml:
            Manually creating the previous weekly was a huge pain, so I started
            looking for better options. Markdown is a complete failure, it can
            not do DT, nor can it be extended to teach it new tricks. Jekyll,
            being in ruby and sharing ruby guys phobia about restructuredtext
            does not support it, one of the main reasons I want to switch to
            [cactus](https://github.com/amitu/Cactus). I finally settled on
            [yaml](http://www.yaml.org/) and a [python
            script](https://github.com/amitu/amitu.github.com/blob/master/weekly/weekly.py)
            to generate the weekly, you can see the [source of this
            weekly](https://github.com/amitu/amitu.github.com/blob/master/weekly/2.yaml)
            in yaml to see how neat it is.

        /india/rape/:
            I have written a rather long post about what is so wrong with the
            rape protests going on in India and what should be done instead.

    - Parasites and pathogens may explain national IQ differences:
        http://www.economist.com/node/16479286:
            Contrary to what Indians like to believe, we have very low IQ on
            average, 82, compared to China - 105, Japan - 105, Singapore - 108,
            US - 98
            \([data](http://media.economist.com/images/20100703/201027STC756.gif)\).
            This study tries to pin the difference on diseases during
            childhood. Katju would have so loved this gif before he had to
            defend himself last week.

    - A jury of their peers - Katju on press regulation:
        http://justicekatju.blogspot.in/2012/11/a-jury-of-their-peers.html:
            Katju is recommending a stronger Press Council, and I have to agree
            on his reasoning. If we can have bar counsil and medical counsil,
            then why not press counsil? Here is a [must watch interview of
            Katju](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Po8iuvy_Q9w)
            on this topic.

    - Nate Silver confuses cause and effect, ends up defending corruption:
        http://mathbabe.org/2012/12/20/nate-silver-confuses-cause-and-effect-ends-up-defending-corruption/:
            This is an excellent read. I have to learn to write more like this.
            Must read for anyone who plans to ever criticize anyone, this is
            how it is done.


    - Are memes copyrighted?:
        http://artherworldblog.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/internet-memes-and-copyright/:
            Answer is yes, but practically speaking copyright owners are acting
            more maturely to internet this time around, and are mostly allowing
            its use.
