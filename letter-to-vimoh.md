Hey,

I like reading your posts, and I think I can say I "get you".

There is one point where you and me differ fundamentally, and that is about "hindu persecution". I like to simply things with respect to you and quite a few others, with this idea that you and lots of others believe that hindus are under some threat. There are different versions, some have a past that they cling to, some fear muslims or christians or americans or whatever are after hindus and India.

Their general thought process is such: one day india was great, the most prosperous country with all good, but we were attacked and attacked, and lots of good has been lost, and chrisitans during british era brain washed us into hating our religion, and muslims in earlier era destroyed all our art and sciences.

Bajrang dal, BJP etc cater to this group, they incite their fear about "others", "pseudo-seculars", constantly trying to put hindus down. They look at everything through this lens. And their entire existance oves itself to this fear.

I believe you belong to this group, "hindus are under some kind of threat". Mind you almost everyone "motivates" people into action by creating some kind of bogeyman or another, and this is our bogeyman.

Me, I do not believe we are in serious danger of that sort. We are fine, we do not need people to burn posters and theaters about my name, in the name of hindu for example, to give threats or otherwise limit the rights of artists and cartoonists etc. That puts me in the "pseudo secular" category I suppose.

Here is my interest, and the point on which I hoping to get your support. I believe we have a real problem in the world.

The problem is that of lie. I believe christians have made it an art of lying. They are sophisticated. They have a well defined canon, set of doctrines  that are never to be deviated from, and they have a pretty good whole picture. It is incorrect, but a christian will go from one statement to next, arguing with you as an art, always lying, but always keeping close to canon, and you can not find a fault in the picture in any new way, they already know all the ways the people attack their canon and they have well defined answers to all of them.

I believe when you start with a lie, like Christ is actual real son of God, and not a good guy, or a mythical fellow etc, you have lie 100 times to support that lie, but a carefully crafter 100 lies can be found that more or less answers most people who are not too critical.

Now christians had huge success, they have one more thing working for them, which is the organization. Catholics not only killed people of other religion, but also people who tried to preach christianity in a local languages too for example, any influence that takes power away from the "roman catholic" branch. They have lots of money, patience, and their primary interest is to sustain themselves instead of spreading christianity, otherwise they wouldnt have driven European countries against each other, wars after wars for example just to make sure all http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot are killed around 1600 or so. Read The Three Musketeers if you havent, awesome book. 

Anyways I do not want to sound conspiracy theorists, but the bottom line is world is suffering a lot because of religion. Religion, esp Chrisians and Muslims, who have the formidable task of believing lies, have made lies acceptable, and praise worthy in fact.

This leads to secondary problem, politicians today are doing the same thing, and so are more and more people, industrialists for example.

I have no notion that I would be able to do much about it, but if you have read Foundation series, I do believe in small changes leading to big results. 

And my thesis is thus: the prevalent lie, and if you disagree from lie as the source of worlds problem, you will at least agree that religion, is causing a lot of problems in the world today. And to solve that, one can take the following approach: realize first that religion can not be replaced by anything which is not religion. 

Logic can not replace religion, not science. There are people who want to believe, who are not interested in all these things. When people see their loved ones die, they need a story about how they are going to either live in peace in eternity or may be they will come back in some other form, people do not want to tell their kids that the mom who just passed away is simply going to rot in the grave. And despite our all scientific efforts religion will keep coming.

So if we accept religion is the source of a lot of problems in world today, and that religion can not be simply destroyed, it leaves us with only one possibility, offer a superior religion.

Now, the moment we talk about superior religion, lots of people get uncomfortable, so many wars have been had in our history when people tried to find whose religion was superior.

But I believe this is complete bullshit. This is a notion christians and muslims want people to believe, they have the biggest bag of lies to sell, and this kind of comparative study of religion is strictly no no for them. If we assume all religion are equal, then no one will say that Abrahamic branch of religion is much bigger bullshit, and is much more responsible for the problems we have had in past and present.

Now if you agree with what I have said so far, let me put forward the proposition that hindu religion has all the elements of being the best religion. It is sufficiently scientific, atheism is completely a valid orthodox position. It accepts other religion without any problem. Being a hindu you can pray to Jesus or Allah if you wanted to, if bible and quaran allowed you to.

Now here are the problem. 1. There are a lot of hindu "leaders", the babas and the Shri Shris. These people are presenting a picture of hinduism that is not what is the best picture. They are too "factionists", I do not believe they call themselves hindu either, I mean who is osho, or who is sai baba, are they hindu? God only knows. 2. Our hindu literature and tradition is full of good things and bad, it allows people to pick up what is not "canon", tho we do not have proper canon, and attack hindus all they want, and present a wrong picture. This is the primary reason we can not get away with castism, which has outlived its utility if there way any utility in the past. This is the reason today hindus are called superstitious, Sati keeps coming up whenever convenient, and so on. We are bogged down by the baggage of past. 

Here is how I want to approach the problem: create a new hinduism.

This is not unprecedented. At one time Budhism spread like wild fire in India, according to Discovery of India, at one time 80-90% of Indians became Budhist. And while things are not very clear, my opinion is Budhism arose out of rejection of Veda, which appealed to a lot, and to counter this, again this is my opinion, Shankaracharya devised a new hinduism that lowered the emphasis on Veda and selected Gita as the replacement as the primary text. Shankaracharya's redifinition of hinduism worked brilliantly and almost most budhist in India converted back to Hinduism. The evidence of this that a change of emphasis from Veda to Gita, is this that you can almost find no Veda physical copy with a common man, and nearly everyone can tell you Gita sar, and Gita is easily available.

I believe, this happened once even before that, when we deemphasised elemental gods, and replaced them with the braham-vishnu-shiv, the conventional "vedic" position if one may say.

We are at a point where it is justified for us to reevaluate our religion, much has happened in terms of science and technology, much of our culture has changed and so forth, so even if you did not agree with the reasoning I presented, if you at least allow for a religion that changes with time, then you will agree that it is high time we consider this.

The element of new hinduism can be discussed, if the reasoning presented sounds reasonable.

One "innovation" I would want included in this is giving away the traditional names. I believe our names tell too much about us, and that is not needed in todays day and age. Amit Upadhyay tells not just that you are referring to me, but also that you are referring to a India, a North Indian, a Brahman if you have understanding of caste system in India and so forth. I believe this information is almost never used for "good" and is only used for segregation and dividing people. I believe that this is a net bad thing, and we must leave it behind, and adopt a naming scheme that takes first name of parents as surname of kids, along with system of husband and wife both changing their surnames to a new surname during marriage. This new surname if picked can be used by kids instead of parent first name as surname. 

Anyways, the above mentioned "innovation" is besides the point. 

I can present to you my ideas on philosophy of veda, the epistemology  the metaphysics, the ethics, this has been become lost, and we can use this has a starting point as you would probably love it, as it is completely scientific and pretty smart. 

I have some more notions that are derived from hinduism and I can list them down, but for now lets see if you agree with this kind of thought process or not.

I believe this is a doable task. We have to convince atheists to stop fighting religion in general, and if they can accept religion can be compared with each other, if they can accept that all religion is not equal, then by formulating a religion based on scientific views, supporting traditions within limits, a religion whose central tenet is not adherance to any god, but to learning, we can get them behind it. (after all atheist are strictly not against just any god, but the abrahamic god, the god that is required to be real, and not the one that is required to be a star of stories spun around them to give life lessons, which is the hindu view).

I believe the biggest problem in making hinduism awesome would be other hindus would would cling to old notions, and more important than that, would be those who would incite fear in other against proponents of this awesome hinduism as some kind of enemies of hinduism, as if suffecient number of people can be convinced that hinduism is under threat, they would vote those who are fighting for them, with money, or with political power and so on.

There would also be those who would not want us to change hinduism one bit, who would cling to existing notions of what they have read in old books. It would be a difficult task, but if it can be made to realize to everyone that we do not have ulteriou motives, that we do strictly respect the religion, the gods, and so on it is doable.

One can argue why call it neo-hinduism at all, why not call it something totally different to avoid the problems in previous to paragraphs, the primary reason is 1. I do belive what I am claiming as new tenets are actually the tenets of original hinduism, atheism is not new, scientific mindset is not new, emphasis on learning is not new, I am just cleaning out the things that are not crucial to hinduism, but has been associated with it due to legacy reasons. 2. If we can do do that, if we can get atheists to agree that religion can only be replaced by other religion, and hindus do not revolt against it, then if best case scenario we will have about a billion followers of this neo hinduism on day zero.
