Hey!

This page features my thoughts about India, the key issues faced by us, and
what we can do to help make India better. Here is what I have so far:

1. [AmitU's Zeroth Law about Legislations](/india/zeroth-law.html)
1. [We, The Mass - Manifesto](http://archive.org/details/WeTheMass-Manifesto) -
   what is the right way to go about protests.
1. [All Indian girls and women must have easy access to tasers](/taser/).
1. [Rape, what is the right way to go about tackling it](/india/rape/). In
   short, increase judicial budgets.
1. [Increase election expense ceilings](/india/ceiling/).
1. No schooling requirements for clearing board exams.

PS: This blog is a [cryptoblog](/2013/07/cryptoblog/), which means [even I can
not modify it without you
knowing](/2013/07/why-is-cryptoblog-impossible-to-hack/). I invite Kejriwal,
and all other politically opinionated to match me in this level of
transparency.
