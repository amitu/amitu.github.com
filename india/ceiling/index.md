Hey!

One of the plagues that India suffers from is corruption in politics. While
corruption in politics is a global phenomena, in India there is a systematic
issue that further makes it impossible for Indian politicians to not be
corrupt. It is the ceiling on how much a politician can spend during election
campaign.

Here is a pdf from [election comission site that shows the ceilings in
different
states](http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/mis-Political_Parties/Election_Expenses/LimiOfElectionExpenses.pdf).
As you can see the maximum money allowed to be spent by a candidate is Rs 25L,
or about $42000 as per todays exchange rate.

Compare this figure with what is [actually
spent](http://www.deccanchronicle.com/130704/commentary-op-ed/commentary/dc-debate-false-ceiling):

> A candidate roughly spends in excess of Rs 10 crore in northern states, while
> it's about Rs 50-100 crore in the southern states.

Election comission is completely toothless to limit the money, and any effort
to do so is a wasted effort, its a cat and mouse game, that politicians will
keep finding loopholes and winning.

The end result is that the money spent is all necessarily black. EC, election
comission, makes it impossible for a fair and honest candidate to fight, no
body can win an election spending 10-20L, when his corrupt opponents are
spending 100s of times more.

This ceiling must be abolished, or adjusted to some number suffeciently high to
reflect the actual election expenditure, 100 Cr or so.

One of my dear friends asked:

The problem is not that the corrupt will not try to funnel more money, they
will, and indeed for that reason the actual limit should be on the higher side,
to counter their ability to spend the money. The real problem is, nobody honest
today has *any hope* of competing against the corrupt. If corrupt politician
spends 10 Cr today, and increases it to 20Cr tomorrow to counter the honest
person who manages to raise a few Crs, the honest person will have a fighting
chance, which is not possible in the measly 10L budget allowed today.

While this will not completely eliminate all political corruption, it will help
the honest ones, as of today, it is impossible condition for honest
politicians. Consider Arvind Kejriwal for example. He is going head on against
Shiela Dixit in Delhi. Shiela is going to spend those 10s and 100s of Cr, but
Kejriwal will be tied by the 20L limit, as he is a honest man, his entire
foundation is his honesty. He will rather give up politics than violate the
laws.

Another point is, we have not yet tested the true power of political fund
raising in India. In US, Obama raised close to a billion dollars, and there is
a very good possibility that the amount of money we can raise with proper fund
raising far outweigh the pocket of corrupts.

Every politician needs money for election. If EC allowed it, at least part of
this money would be accounted for, and that alone is a win in my opinion. The
fact that it gives come honest politicians a fighting chance is just a bonus.
All in all, if what I am demanding is implemented, it will be positive for
India, with very little negative.
