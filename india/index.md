Hey!

This page features my thoughts about India, the key issues faced by us. what we
can do to help make India better. Here is what I have so far:

1. [We, The Mass - Manifesto](http://archive.org/details/WeTheMass-Manifesto) -
   what is the right way to go about protests.
1. [All Indian girls and women must have easy access to tasers](/taser/).
1. [Rape, what is the right way to go about tackling it](/india/rape/). In
   short, increase judicial budgets.
1. [Increase election expense ceilings](/india/ceiling/).
1. No schooling requirements for clearing board exams.
