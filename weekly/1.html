#### Programming & Geeky Stuff

    <dd>

        For a survey I decided to use google spreadsheet with their form.
        Problem: I can not edit my data. Also I wanted to show summary in real
        time as data is being entered. Read a bit <a href="/lab/">more</a>
        about it.

    </dt>
    <dd>

        About why Google Chrome and other webkit/modern browsers do not
        "properly" support onunload event because they "hide" the page. (Also:
        <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onbeforeunload">onbeforeunload</a>).

        <a href="http://nytimes.com">NYTimes</a> started charging for their
        article some time back. Apparently move worked brilliantly for them.
        Internet may not kill news after all.

    <dt><a href="https://github.com/koenbok/Cactus">Cactus: Static Site Generator</a></dt>
    <dd>

        My site runs on <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a>
        and am a big fan of static site generators. No deployment issues, no
        headache of site ever going down or requiring debugging. And almost
        full benefit of rich features for writing content. But I want python,
        and I am currently in love with Cactus. I am planning to fork the
        project to a different direction as I have quite a few plans with it.

    <dt><a href="http://erlangonxen.org/">Erlang on Xen</a></dt>
    <dd>

        This is quite awesome, erlang and xen as the whole virtual machine, no
        operating system, no other processes. Startup time within 100ms. This
        is low enough that an xen instance that serves the web request and the
        erlang application that actually handles it can both be launched after
        the browser has made the request.

#### Politics & India & Philosophy

    <dt><a href="/2012/12/reddit-for-aaam-aadmi-party/">Reddit For Aaam Aadmi Party</a></dt>
    <dd>

        I have created a new subreddit: <a
        href="http://www.reddit.com/r/aap">/r/aap</a>. I believe Kejriwal has
        right intentions but is complete fool in terms of strategy. He still
        deserves our support as he is trying to do the right thing, but he does
        not know what right is. I have argued why this subreddit may help give
        him better direction. Please subscribe to the subreddit, and spread the
        word about it.

    <dt><a href="http://justicekatju.blogspot.in/">Justice Katju's Blog</a></dt>
    <dd>

        Justice Katju, Chairman Press Council of India, Former Judge Supreme
        Court Of India, has a blog. Some interesting defense of <a
        href="http://justicekatju.blogspot.in/2012/02/sanskrit-as-language-of-science.html">Sanskrit</a>
        there (and an awesome comment destroying his thesis). Love this man,
        though, in my opinion, he has some nutty ideas.

    </dd>

    <dt><a href="/2012/12/guns-vs-mobs/">Guns Vs Mobs</a></dt>
    <dd>

        An article by me about how guns are an insurance against mob, and why
        they should be legal, despite the incidences like recurring US
        shootouts. Recent delhi gang rape in public shows how important it is
        for Indians to be self suffecient in terms of their security.

    </dd>

    <dt><a href="/taser/">Women must own Taser (Stun Gun) In India</a></dt>
    <dd>

        Another article by me advocating tasers or stun guns, as a must have
        tool for women. Unlike guns it does not require permits, so is
        plausible today, and is cheap and safe.

#### Personal Stuff & Random Thoughts

    <dt>First Weekly Newletter</dt>
    <dd>

        This is my first weekly newsletter, after sitting on this idea for
        months I have decided to write one. It arose from a need to share
        links, writing an individual post about each link is too much. Tweet is
        also not good as then my links get lost and 160 characters is too
        little. So now I have a file containing all the neat articles I read
        worth preserving, and at the end of week I am planning to send it as my
        newsletter.

        I am planning to have a page about all the tools I use, in the
        meanwhile I would say these two rock. I am <a
        href="http://www.instapaper.com">reading lot more</a> thanks to one and
        <a href="http://evernote.com">writing more</a> thanks to the other.

    <dt><a href="/flash/">Flash For Python Programmers</a></dt>
    <dd>

        I am quite enjoying working with flash, and to be frank I quite feared
        flash all this while. These could be called the last few years of
        flash, but because it is such a cool technology I hope it lasts. In the
        meanwhile I am writing in a bookish form my notes on flash, intended
        for fellow python gprogrammers for learning flash from scratch, with
        bias towards game development.

        Just finished this novel. <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a>
        probably had nicer ideas, but this one has more litrary value. Highly
        recommended.

    <dt><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1446192/">Rise of the Guardians</a></dt>
    <dd>

        I quite liked this movie. It is a fine Christmas movie, but what I
        really loved was the little things they changed. Everything was fresh,
        a Santa Clause that looked distintly Russian or Viking like, with a
        Russianish house, and swords in both his hands! How awesome is that!
        Yetis instead of his usual minions building the tools. Good will win if
        even one person believed in it shown in a very convincing manner
        without preaching. I feel the other characters made the movie less
        Christian, and more story driven, Sandman was distintly Budhdha like
        looking. Awesome battles.
