    - My Git Flow:
        pass:
            Off late I am using branches a lot when working with git. I
            considered using [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) but
            its not working, as the whole team is not using it and I am not
            getting to configure it to treat master as my develop branch. I had
            very bad experience with
            [git-up](https://github.com/aanand/git-up), it lost my commits!,
            and now with this I am feeling that it is probably best to stay
            away from these tools and use more stable tools that come with git
            directly to implement the workflow we like.

    - Don't Lecture me:
        http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/tomorrows-college/lectures/:
            Lecture based learning dates back to a time when it was unviable to
            print books. If you couldn't print content you needed to dictate it
            to students. Why are we still doing this?
