        About why Google Chrome and other webkit/modern browsers do not
        "properly" support onunload event because they "hide" the page. (Also:
        <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onbeforeunload">onbeforeunload</a>).

        <a href="http://nytimes.com">NYTimes</a> started charging for their
        article some time back. Apparently move worked brilliantly for them.
        Internet may not kill news after all.

#### Politics & India & Philosophy

        Justice Katju, Chairman Press Council of India, Former Judge Supreme
        Court Of India, has a blog. Some interesting defense of <a
        href="http://justicekatju.blogspot.in/2012/02/sanskrit-as-language-of-science.html">Sanskrit</a>
        there (and an awesome comment destroying his thesis). Love this man,
        though, in my opinion, he has some nutty ideas.

    <dd>

        An article by me about how guns are an insurance against mob, and why
        they should be legal, despite the incidences like recurring US
        shootouts. Recent delhi gang rape in public shows how important it is
        for Indians to be self suffecient in terms of their security.

    <dd>

        Another article by me advocating tasers or stun guns, as a must have
        tool for women. Unlike guns it does not require permits, so is
        plausible today, and is cheap and safe.
