#### Programming & Geeky Stuff

        For a survey I decided to use google spreadsheet with their form.
        Problem: I can not edit my data. Also I wanted to show summary in real
        time as data is being entered. Read a bit <a href="/lab/">more</a>
        about it.

    </dt>
    <dd>

        About why Google Chrome and other webkit/modern browsers do not
        "properly" support onunload event because they "hide" the page. (Also:
        <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onbeforeunload">onbeforeunload</a>).

        <a href="http://nytimes.com">NYTimes</a> started charging for their
        article some time back. Apparently move worked brilliantly for them.
        Internet may not kill news after all.

    <dd>

        My site runs on <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a>
        and am a big fan of static site generators. No deployment issues, no
        headache of site ever going down or requiring debugging. And almost
        full benefit of rich features for writing content. But I want python,
        and I am currently in love with Cactus. I am planning to fork the
        project to a different direction as I have quite a few plans with it.

#### Politics & India & Philosophy

<dl>
    <dt><a href="http://justicekatju.blogspot.in/">Justice Katju's Blog</a></dt>
    <dd>

        Justice Katju, Chairman Press Council of India, Former Judge Supreme
        Court Of India, has a blog. Some interesting defense of <a
        href="http://justicekatju.blogspot.in/2012/02/sanskrit-as-language-of-science.html">Sanskrit</a>
        there (and an awesome comment destroying his thesis). Love this man,
        though, in my opinion, he has some nutty ideas.

    <dt><a href="/2012/12/guns-vs-mobs/">Guns Vs Mobs</a></dt>
    <dd>

        An article by me about how guns are an insurance against mob, and why
        they should be legal, despite the incidences like recurring US
        shootouts. Recent delhi gang rape in public shows how important it is
        for Indians to be self suffecient in terms of their security.

    </dd>

    <dt><a href="/taser/">Women must own Taser (Stun Gun) In India</a></dt>
    <dd>

        Another article by me advocating tasers or stun guns, as a must have
        tool for women. Unlike guns it does not require permits, so is
        plausible today, and is cheap and safe.

#### Personal Stuff & Random Thoughts

<dl>
    <dt>First Weekly Newletter</dt>
    <dd>

        This is my first weekly newsletter, after sitting on this idea for
        months I have decided to write one. It arose from a need to share
        links, writing an individual post about each link is too much. Tweet is
        also not good as then my links get lost and 160 characters is too
        little. So now I have a file containing all the neat articles I read
        worth preserving, and at the end of week I am planning to send it as my
        newsletter.

    <dd>

        I am planning to have a page about all the tools I use, in the
        meanwhile I would say these two rock. I am <a
        href="http://www.instapaper.com">reading lot more</a> thanks to one and
        <a href="http://evernote.com">writing more</a> thanks to the other.

    <dt><a href="/flash/">Flash For Python Programmers</a></dt>
    <dd>

        I am quite enjoying working with flash, and to be frank I quite feared
        flash all this while. These could be called the last few years of
        flash, but because it is such a cool technology I hope it lasts. In the
        meanwhile I am writing in a bookish form my notes on flash, intended
        for fellow python gprogrammers for learning flash from scratch, with
        bias towards game development.
