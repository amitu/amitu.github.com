What is special about kindle that is not possible on web based reader? When I
change font size on kindle, the first word on current page remains the first
word of the page with new font size. This is *huge*. It allows me to change
font size without losing where I was. On web when I resize, especially long
texts, I lose my position very once in a while, and this negative feedback
makes sure I do not resize on web.

My [reader](/labs/reader.html) tries to solve this for web.

Status: Work in progress.
